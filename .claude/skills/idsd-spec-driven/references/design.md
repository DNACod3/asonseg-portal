# Design

**Goal**: Define HOW to build it. Architecture, components, what to reuse.

**Skip this phase when:** The change is straightforward — no architectural decisions, no new patterns, no component interactions to plan. For simple features, design happens inline during Execute.

## 🧬 ICE Mode: resolve pointers, do NOT decompose architecture

When the project has an ICE layer, **this phase does not design anything new** — the architecture is already frozen in `docs/architecture/technical-design.md` + ADRs + runbooks. The skill's own boundary says so: *"Do NOT use for architecture decomposition or technical design docs."* In ICE mode, `design.md` for a USP is the **resolution of the card's pointers**, nothing more:

| design.md section | In ICE mode, fill it by RESOLVING… |
|---|---|
| Architecture Overview | The card's `Fase` + the relevant slice of the system diagram in `architecture-document.md` §4 — quoted, not redrawn |
| Code Reuse Analysis | The **runbooks** the card lists (each is a reusable recipe) + the entities/schemas already defined in **TD §4.5** |
| Components / Interfaces | The endpoints the card points to in **TD §4.4** (e.g. `estornarEvento`, `corrigirEvento`) — copied, not invented |
| Data Models | The schemas in **TD §4.5** (e.g. `events.estornado_em/por`, `audit_log`) — referenced by anchor, not re-typed |
| Tech Decisions | **Already decided** in ADRs 0008–0014. Point to `ADR-NNNN`. Record a NEW micro-decision only if implementation forces one the TD didn't cover. |
| Error Handling | The failure-modes→containment table in `architecture-document.md` §5 + the 🚨/⚠️ gotchas in the runbooks |

**Hard rule:** if implementation would contradict an ADR or the TD, that is **NOT a local design decision** — it is a re-entry into `architecture-planning-idsd` (delta / Passo 0). The executor never re-decides what an ADR fixed. Resolve, quote, point — never re-derive.

If there is no ICE layer, ignore this block and use the generative Process below.

## Process

### 1. Load Context

Read `.specs/features/[feature]/spec.md` before designing. If `.specs/features/[feature]/context.md` exists, load it too — it contains implementation decisions that constrain the design (layout choices, behavior preferences, interaction patterns). Decisions marked as "Agent's Discretion" are yours to decide.

### 1.5. Research (Optional but Recommended)

If the feature involves unfamiliar technology, patterns, or integrations, research before designing. Document findings briefly in the design doc or as inline notes. This prevents incorrect assumptions from propagating into tasks.

Follow the **Knowledge Verification Chain** (see SKILL.md) in strict order:

```
Codebase → Project docs → Context7 MCP → Web search → Flag as uncertain
```

**CRITICAL: NEVER assume or fabricate information.** If you cannot find an answer through the chain, explicitly say "I don't know" or "I couldn't find documentation for this". Inventing an API, a pattern, or a behavior that doesn't exist is far worse than admitting uncertainty. Wrong assumptions propagate through design → tasks → implementation and cause cascading failures.

Good triggers for research: new libraries, unfamiliar APIs, performance-sensitive features, security-sensitive features, patterns you haven't used in this codebase before.

### 2. Define Architecture

Overview of how components interact. Use mermaid diagrams when helpful. Before creating any diagrams, check if the `mermaid-studio` skill is available (see Skill Integrations in SKILL.md).

### 3. Identify Code Reuse

**CRITICAL**: What existing code can we leverage? This saves tokens and reduces errors.

If `.specs/codebase/CONCERNS.md` exists, check it before designing. Any component flagged as fragile, carrying tech debt, or having test coverage gaps requires extra care in the design — document how the design mitigates those concerns.

### 4. Define Components and Interfaces

Each component: Purpose, Location, Interfaces, Dependencies, What it reuses.

### 5. Define Data Models

If the feature involves data, define models before implementation.

- **Dependencies**: [What it needs to function]
- **Reuses**: [Existing code this builds upon]

## Tips

- **Load context first** — If context.md exists, decisions there are locked
- **Research when uncertain** — 5 minutes of research prevents hours of rework
- **Reuse is king** — Every component should reference existing patterns
- **Interfaces first** — Define contracts before implementation
- **Keep it visual** — Diagrams save 1000 words (check mermaid-studio skill in Skill Integrations)
- **Small components** — If component does 3+ things, split it
- **Check CONCERNS.md** — If it exists, flag fragile areas the design must address
- **Confirm before Tasks** — User approves design before breaking into tasks
